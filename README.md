# Simple-Neural-Network
This program is to: firstly, illustrate how a neural network works and secondly, why deep learning is such an important foothold in machine learning and AI.

The idea of this program is to build a simple neural network with some basic components: 
1) An input layer, x
2) An arbitrary amount of hidden layers
3) An output layer, ŷ
4) A set of weights and biases between each layer, W and b
5) A choice of activation function for each hidden layer, σ

Each iteration of the training process consists of the following steps:
  1)Calculating the predicted output ŷ, known as Feedforward
  2)Updating the weights and biases, known as Backpropagation

Then I am using matplotlib to plot a line graph. In it, you all could see how the model is improved.
The loss function I'm using is least squares error. 

Enjoy!
